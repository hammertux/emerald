## About

Hi! I am a Computer Science Master student at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. I am currently following the Computer Systems Security track run by VUSec. I am mainly interested in low level topics. Some keywords related to my interests include memory safety, Linux kernel, side channels, fault injection and compilers.
